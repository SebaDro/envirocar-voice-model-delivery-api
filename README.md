## Installation
- Install dependencies
    ```sh

    ```
- Create `.env` (take reference from `.env-sample`)
- Create `assets` folder in the project directory and add model files in it.
Latest released model file must contain the word `latest` (Case Insensitive) in it's filename, so that it is served at `/latest` endpoint. Eg: `Vosk-Model-Latest.7z` 

## Deploy

    node run start
    ```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Request Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latest` | `GET` | Returns the latest model file |
| `models` | `GET` | Returns a JSON list of available models |
| `models/:name` | `GET` | Returns model file with the filename `name` if it exists else returns a `404`. Eg: `<address>/models/Vosk-Model-Latest.7z` returns `Vosk-Model-Latest.7z` model file |
| `refresh` | `GET` | Refreshes the models list and returns the operation result (Useful when new models are added) |

## Logs

- `app.log`
- `error.log`
